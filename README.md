# Justcats' APB page
I made this page to help beginners and intermediate APB solvers with their recognition and algorithms.

## Content
### First block resources
Some challenges I made up and other people's resources. 
### EO case recognition
For the beginner's method only, I have yet to make a full EO pair trainer. This is a recognition trainer for all the cases in solved pair EO pair.
### LXS case recognition
Train your LXS recognition or learn the algs, you can select sets and specific algs. Forgot an alg? Just unhide the solution!
### Other people's resources
Stuff that I didn't make but is sure worth looking at!
